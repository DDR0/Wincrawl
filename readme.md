# Wincrawl

A small, non-euclidean dungeon crawler.

Status: You can walk around a small, non-euclidean dungeon.

Plans as follow:



## World Gen

Colourful, geometric shapes should be painted on the floor of the dungeon to assist with navigation. Symbols should adorn the walls. Lamps should light the way, and coloured glass cast many-hued shadows.



## Races and Conflict

As you go through the dungeon, most conflict can be solved without the use of violence. Talking your way out of things is your primary, and best, weapon. Generally, talking is implemented as a minigame representing the tone of the conversation. The minigames can bleed over into each other when multiple participants are involved, or if a creature is in a noncharacteristic mood. For example, a Stone Elf in a grumpy mood may simply snap at you, which would be represented as a goblin-style conversation.

1. Goblin
	- **Talking**: A verbal sparring match represented by a real one! Since goblins are pretty basic creatures, they respect physical might - so the stronger you are, the more advantage you'll have in the fight! The strength of your argument vs theirs grants bonuses or detriments. Combat takes place in the mind, so no permanent damage is done. Be careful not to win too hard - they might attack in real life because they've been humiliated, and things might not go so well!
	- **Fighting**: Hard-hitting and well-armoured, but not very evasive. As with talking, straight to the point. Not a fan of ranged weapons - goblins tend not to think very far ahead. Tend to fight longer and surrender when defeated.

2. Stone Elves
	- **Talking** with these beings is like an elegant dance. Much like DDR or Guitar Hero, hit the keys at the right time. The strength of your argument determines how much leeway you have in hitting the keys, and forgiveness for missing them; the strength of their argument determines how many keys you have to hit and how fast.
	- **Fighting**: Dodgy little bastards. Prefer ranged weapons and fast movement. Tend to run away before being defeated.

3. Esper
	- **Talking**: These aggressive esper-snakes in the dungeon are very, very clever - quite over your level, to be frank. Talking with them resembles running a poorly-built raft down a river - you can only hope not to capsize along the way to your conversation's conclusion! You cannot keep secrets from an esper, they know what you know. The strength of your argument determines how quickly you can navigate the flow of conversation, the strength of the esper's how fast and narrow the river is.
	- **Fighting**: Actually managing to fight an esper is rather hard, because they tend to rearrange reality on you. Either by putting distance between you, or wrapping the tile you're on back on itself to effectively put you between you and it, or simply twisting off the little bubble of reality you're in.
